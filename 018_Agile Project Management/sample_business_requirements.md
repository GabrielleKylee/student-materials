New Donation Process

Executive Summary

This document will help you to understand the experience the client would like their donors to have while on their website. The client has made it simple to find where to donate of their website but this organization struggles to make the donation process simple after selecting the "Donate Now" button has due to their multiple key items that donors have the opportunity to give towards. With many options come many routes/ways to give and has caused confusion in the past. This client is looking to simplify their donation process while still giving their donors the same amount of items to give to. 

This client would like their donation process to be split into three pages that transition smoothly from the first to last. The first page would gather the needed contact information. The second page will flow from drop down option to drop down option depending of what was category of giving was selected until identifying the items that the donor desires to give towards. The second page will also include a "Donor Note" option that allows the donor to make a note in regards to their giving or identify their giving if it was not found in the options in the drop downs. The third page will collect their payment information and give them the choice to create an account for faster check out. 

All details are included in this document.

Business Objectives

The objectives are as followed: 
- Create a clean and simple process for the organizations donors to give.
- The giving process needs to be efficient. 
- Design should be minimal but include brand colors and fonts.
- The donor form needs to work with the organizations CRM and the payment processer. 

Background

This organization is faith-based and has many individuals that raise their our support to continue to work. The money raised by these individuals is raised through this organization therefore there needs to be a way for the individual donors to give towards them on the website. The process they have currently confuses the donor and does not properly document information on the backend in their CRM and payment process. The development department is constantly missing donations that have been designated to an individual because of this failed documentation. They are needed an efficient and simple way for the donor confusion to subside and the development team to easily identify what funds are going where. The organization also struggles with a constancy following their brand guides but desires to be constant. They do have a brand guide that includes colors, fonts, wording, etc. 

Scope

- CRM (NEON) 
- Payment Process (Applos) 
- Bridge that allows NEON to communicate to Applos
- Word Press account
- NEON is the currently hosting the client’s forms
- Two bank accounts needing to be deposited to

Functional requirements

When the "Donate Now" is clicked on from the Home page it will navigate to a page that has a transparent box that includes a photo and a description to influence the viewer to donate to the cause. 

You will scroll down to find a radio style giving bar starting at $25, $50, $100, $200, $500 with a small red heart the left of the $100 radio button. This will include a header named "Select your giving amount". As you move down the page you will see the next header "Contact Information", it will have fill in text boxes named: Full Name, Address, and Email Address. On the bottom right corner there should be a small blue (brand color) button that says "Next". When the "Next" button is called, it will go to the giving description page. 

The giving description page will have a header that says "Select giving option below". There will be 10 photos. These photos will need to include the following: Europe, Eurasia, Northern Asia, North America, Southern Asia, Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific, General Fund and People. Once one of these photos is selected it will slide you down the page that has a header that says "Want to get More specific?" There will be a two drop down menus that will be named "person" and "project". The individual will be able to move forward without filling out more information by check a box that says "No more information is needed". This process will be used for all photos except the one descripted as "People". Once individual clicked the "People" photo it will slide down and open to a header that says "select individual here" with a drop down that includes a list of names that will be provided. This will be followed with a header saying "Do not see who you are looking for, type name here?" with a text box for donor to enter in a name. On the bottom right corner there should be a small blue (brand color) button that says "Next". When the "Next" button is called, it will go to the payment option page. If the individual selects the General Fund option allow it to automatically drop down to the “Next” button. The General Fund is the only giving page that will need to be linked to a different bank account than the other giving pages. Bank account links will be given when during Phase 3.

The payment option page needs to include a card and PayPal option. If PayPal option is selected it will take them to PayPal to complete their payment. If PayPal option is not select the donor will need to a text box field for the following: Name on card, card on address/same as mailing address, card number and CRV code. Once all is fill out, (error needs to be thrown if all of this information was not answered) on the bottom right corner there should be a small blue (brand color) button that says "Submit Payment". When the "Submit Payment" button is called, it will go to a Thank you page. 



The Thank you page will simply need to same "Thank you for giving to put hope within the reach of many individuals! Go back to explore our website.(Website is hyperlinked to the website)" Under the text will insert a video that also thanks the donor. 

*All photos and text are included in this email.

Making sure it meets the client’s needs on the backend. We will also need a project manager that will continue to communicate with the client’s development team.

Assumptions
This system reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API, NEON, The Bridge and Applos.
